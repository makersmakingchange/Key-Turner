<!--- Open Source Assistive Technology: GitHub Readme Template Version 1.2 (2024-May-27)  --->


<!--- INSTRUCTIONS --->
<!--- This is a markdown template for creating the README.md file in a GitHub repository. This file is rendered and displayed automatically when someone visits the repository.

This document includes helper text that will not be displayed when rendered. Any text between the less-than sign + exclamation mark + three hyphen-minus (<!---) and matching three hyphen-minus + greater-than sign will not be displayed. This helper text can be deleted once the corresponding section is completed.

This template has a number of fields that can be searched and replaced with other text:
 - Key_Turner Replace this with filename-friendly version of the device with underscores. e.g., Open_Wobble_Switch
 - <DeviceName> Replace this with the human-readable name of the device with spaces. e.g., Open Wobble Switch
 - <DesignerName> Replace this with the person or organization responsible for the design. e.g., John Doe.
 - <Repository_Link> Replace this with the web address for the repository. e.g., (e.g., https://github.com/makersmakingchange/Open-Wobble-Switch))
 - <MMCWebLink> This is the website address including an alphanumeric id for the Makers Making Change Website. e.g., 01tJR000000698oYAA. This will come from MMC staff.  
 - <MaterialCost> Replace this with the dollar cost and currency (CAD, USD, etc.) of the materials of the device.
 - <ShippingCost> Replace this with the dollar cost and currency (CAD, USD, etc.) of shipping the device (if possible).
 - <YEAR> year(s) of the copyright
 
Any text that is currently holding a space / is an instruction for the person filling in the README is in all capitals, to make it easier to see them in a rendered version.

<!--- TITLE --->
# Key Turner
<!--- Should match the name of the GitHub repository. Choose something descriptive rather than whimsical.  --->

## Overview
<!--- A brief summary of the project. What it does, who it is for, how much it costs. --->
The Key Turner is an assistive technology device that helps people with arthritis or other disabilities to operate their keys. Users loop their finger through the hole and twist to lock and unlock doors with minimal wrist movement. The large key bed can accommodate various shape of key heads. 

The device is comprised of off-the-shelf hardware components and 3D printed parts. 

The Key Turner is open assistive technology (OpenAT). Under the terms of the open source licenses, the device may be built, used, and improved upon by anyone.

The overall cost of materials is about $1.70.
